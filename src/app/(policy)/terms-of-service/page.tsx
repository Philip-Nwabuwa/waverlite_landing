        3. Registration Information
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        3.1 In order to use the Waverlite Remittance Facility Platform, you must
        be at least 18 years old, be a resident of Canada, the US, the UK and
        Eurozone, or another origination country approved by Waverlite, have a
        Payment Account in your name in the approved origination country, and be
        registered with Waverlite.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        In order to register, you must register on the Platform and provide
        Waverlite with information about yourself, such as your name, address,
        date of birth, telephone number, email address, and other information or
        documentation that will allow us to verify your identify. The home
        address that you provide when registering must be the same as the
        billing address for your debit card or prepaid card.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        You agree to provide complete and accurate information and/or
        documentation in connection with the registration process and you
        further agree to update this information as may be reasonable or
        necessary to keep it complete and accurate at all times.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        3.2 Your use of the Platform is subject to our ability to verify your
        identity. You authorize Waverlite to obtain information about you from
        third parties (including financial institutions and credit reporting
        agencies), although Waverlite has no obligation to do so. If you do not
        provide accurate and complete information during registration or when
        requesting a Remittance, we have the right to prohibit you from using
        the Service or the Platform or to stop your requested Remittance.
        Inaccurate and/or incomplete information provided by you during
        registration or when requesting a Remittance may cause errors in your
        requested Remittance, or may delay or restrict your access to the
        Platform or the Service.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        3.3 Each time you access the Waverlite Remittance Facility Platform, you
        shall be deemed to have confirmed the accuracy and completeness of all
        of your registration information.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        3.4 Your registration is personal to you. You should not allow your
        registration details to be used by anyone else. Registration with
        Waverlite allows your Payment Account to be accessed through the
        Platform. If you lose your phone or believe your access to the Platform
        has been compromised, you should contact Waverlite immediately at
        support@waverlite.email to change your password or disable your access
        to the Platform.

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">
        4. Description of the Service
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        4.1 You may use the Platform only to send a Remittance to a Beneficiary
        located in a country where Waverlite provides payment service, as
        designated on the Platform from time to time. Waverlite and
        Waverlite-designated service providers will process the remittance and
        make funds available for receipt by the Beneficiary as described below.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        4.2 Your use of the Platform or the Service does not constitute or
        create a partnership, fiduciary or escrow capacity between you and
        Waverlite. Waverlite provides a remittance service only; the funds that
        you direct Waverlite to pay to your Beneficiary are not held by
        Waverlite as a deposit or in escrow, and Waverlite is not holding or
        processing your Remittance as a fiduciary. Waverlite's only obligation
        is to pay your Remittance to your Beneficiary or to return the principal
        amount of the Remittance to you.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        4.3 The Service is generally available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
        although there may be times when the Service is unavailable to you or to
        your Beneficiary. Periods of unavailability may be caused by Waverlite's
        own acts (such as temporary periods when the Service is taken off-line
        to make upgrades or improvements), or by events beyond Waverlite's
        control, such as power outages, telecommunications failures, war or
        civil unrest, natural disasters or other acts of God. Waverlite may from
        time to time set limits on the value of Remittances you may send (both
        individually and over a period of time), as well as the value of
        Remittances any Beneficiary may receive. Waverlite may delay payment of
        your Remittance to allow Waverlite to determine that your Remittance
        complies with applicable law, regulation or Waverlite policies.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        Waverlite has the right, without notice to you, to refuse to accept or
        pay any Remittance that Waverlite determines in our sole discretion may
        violate applicable law, regulation or our policies, including laws,
        regulations, and policies intended to help detect and prevent
        money-laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other abuses of
        financial services; if we accept a Remittance and then determine that it
        may violate any such law, regulation or policy, we may hold the
        Remittance until such time that the matter is resolved.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">
        5. Authority to Charge Payment Account; Fees and Expenses
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        5.1 In order to use the Service, you must use the Platform to direct
        Waverlite to withdraw the principal value of the Remittance from your
        Payment Account, plus any applicable fees and charges; by requesting a
        Remittance, you authorize Waverlite to charge your Payment Account for
        the principal amount of the requested Remittance and applicable fees and
        charges, if any. You acknowledge that Waverlite has no obligation to
        process or complete a requested Remittance if Waverlite is unable for
        any reason to obtain authorization or settlement of the funds from your
        Payment Account for the principal amount of the requested Remittance and
        all applicable fees and charges.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        5.2 Waverlite will disclose its fees and charges for providing the
        Service to you before you initiate a Remittance. Waverlite's fees and
        charges may change from time to time, and may depend, among other
        factors, on the principal amount of your Remittance, your type of
        Payment Account, your location, and the location of your Beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        In addition to the fees and charges, Waverlite will also show you the
        foreign exchange rate (that is, the rate at which your funds will be
        converted into the currency to be paid to your Beneficiary) applicable
        to your Remittance before you send it. Waverlites foreign exchange rates
        change from time to time. In addition to the fees and charges you pay
        when sending a Remittance, Waverlite makes money when we convert the
        currency you send into the currency we pay to your Beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        5.3 If the charge to your Payment Account is returned, charged-back or
        canceled for any reason after Waverlite has processed your Remittance
        request, you will be responsible to Waverlite for the principal amount
        of the Remittance and all associated fees and charges. You agree to pay
        such amounts, plus any applicable additional service fee and/or a
        non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee of $10 USD as a result of the return to
        Waverlite immediately upon demand. You authorize us to debit your
        Payment Account for the amount of any of the foregoing amounts. You may
        be subject to fees (including a cash advance fee) under your agreement
        with the bank or other financial institution that issues your debit card
        when you use such a card for a Remittance. You should review your card
        agreement regarding such potential fees.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        5.4 Although Waverlite will pay the full principal amount of your
        Transaction to your Beneficiary in the currency Waverlite specifies to
        you when you initiate your Remittance, your Beneficiary may incur costs,
        fees or charges from his or her bank, mobile phone company, E-Wallet
        issuer or other party to maintain or withdraw the funds. Furthermore,
        your Beneficiary's ability to use or withdraw the funds you send may be
        limited by the terms of your Beneficiary's E-Wallet issuer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">6. Reliance by Waverlite</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        Use care when inputting information about your Beneficiary; spell your
        Beneficiary's name correctly and provide it in full, and verify that you
        have provided us with the Beneficiary's correct phone number, email
        address and or account number. You represent and warrant to us that all
        information you enter into the Platform or otherwise provide to
        Waverlite is true and complete, including information about you, your
        Payment Account, and your Beneficiary. When processing a Remittance
        Payment, Waverlite may rely on the registration information and
        Remittance information that you provide, including information about
        your Beneficiary. You acknowledge that any errors in the information you
        provide, including misidentification of Beneficiary(s), incorrect or
        inconsistent account names and numbers, or misspellings, are your
        responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">
        7. Execution of a Remittance
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        The Waverlite Remittance Facility Platform is generally available 24
        hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Generally, your Beneficiary
        is paid instantly through the Waverlite service Platform; accordingly,
        once you originate a Remittance, you may be unable to stop or change it.
        If ever there is a situation where your transaction is not delivered
        instantly to the Beneficiary, we will contact you and keep you informed
        about the delay.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        In the event that any of these Terms is held to be invalid or
        unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
        minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms
        will remain in full effect. JOCHEBED's failure to enforce any right or
        provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or
        provision.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">
        8. Payment of Funds to Beneficiary
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        8.1 Waverlite and/or Waverlite designated service providers will arrange
        for the payment of the Remittance to your Beneficiary. Waverlite
        reserves the right to select the form of payment to the Beneficiary.
        Waverlite and/or Waverlite designated service providers will use
        reasonable efforts to provide payment in a form requested, but the
        Platform is not obligated to provide payment options for a specific
        Payment. Depending on the situation and the availability of various
        payment options, payment may be made by means of a credit to a mobile
        wallet, currency (cash), by check, by stored value card, credit to a
        bank account or credit card account, or by some other payment
        instrument. Not all payment methods are available in all countries, and
        Waverlite reserves the right to change payment method options. If a
        Beneficiary cannot be located and identified, the Remittance Payment
        funds may be returned to you either by a credit to your Payment Account
        or by check, at Waverlite's option.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        8.2 Waverlite reserves the right to establish identification and
        verification requirements for a Beneficiary to receive a Remittance.
        Waverlite may rely, without further investigation, upon identification
        information or documentation provided by you or a Beneficiary, including
        any code or identifier number of the Remittance, when paying the
        Beneficiary. Waverlite has the right to decline to pay the Beneficiary
        if Waverlite cannot verify the identity of the Beneficiary or if
        Waverlite believes that you or your Beneficiary may be in violation of
        this Agreement or any applicable law, regulation or Waverlite policy.
        Although Waverlite has the right to establish identification and
        verification requirements, and the Beneficiary's failure to comply with
        them is a basis to decline payment of the Remittance, Waverlite has no
        obligation to establish any such requirements.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">9. Foreign Exchange</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        9.1 Payments to Beneficiaries are generally made in the currency of the
        Beneficiary's country.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        9.2 If a currency conversion is required, Waverlite and/or
        Waverlite-designated service providers will convert the currency in
        which you initiate your Remittance into the local currency at the
        Waverlite exchange rate for your Remittance in effect at the time you
        initiate your Remittance. Waverlite will disclose the exchange rate to
        you before you authorize the Remittance. Waverlite's exchange rates vary
        from time to time, and may also differ depending on the principal value
        of your Remittance and other factors. In addition to the fees and
        charges applicable to your Remittance, Waverlite makes money when your
        currency is converted into the currency in which your Remittance is
        paid.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">

        The Platform is not intended for use by any person in any jurisdiction

          enforce currency or exchange rate controls.

        You agree that you will only request a Remittance that complies with

        Remittances on your own behalf. You may not resell the Platform or use
        the Platform to make Remittances on behalf of, or as agent for, another
        person.

        You will provide information and/or documentation that Waverlite may
        request from time to time in order for Waverlite to comply with any
        applicable laws, including anti-money laundering laws. Waverlite may
        refuse payment of any Remittance which Waverlite determines in its sole
        discretion does not comply with applicable law, Waverlite policy, or the
        terms of this Agreement.

        11. Rejection of Remittance Payment Request
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        11.1 We reserve the right to reject your request for a Remittance, or to
        decline to complete a request for a Remittance, or to impose a value or
        frequency limitation on your use of the Service, without cause or prior
        notice to you. Without limiting the foregoing, we may suspend, delay or

        circumstances, however, where the law requires Waverlite to hold your
        Remittance or to pay it to another party (including a government
        agency). If that happens, Waverlite will inform you, if we are permitted
        to do so by applicable law.

        12. Limitation of Liability
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        Waverlite is not responsible for any delay, failure to execute, or an
        error in the execution of your Remittance request due to circumstances
        beyond Waverlite's reasonable control, whether caused by strikes, power
        failures, equipment malfunctions, war, riots, governmental or court
        orders, work stoppages or similar occurrences or circumstances, or
        incorrect or incomplete information provided by you. You further agree
        that Waverlite may refuse to process or delay processing any request if
        it would violate any guideline, rule, policy or regulation of any
        government authority or funds transfer system.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        Under no circumstances will Waverlite be liable for damages, whether
        caused by the negligence of Waverlite's employees, contractors, agents
        or others, beyond the sum of ONE THOUSAND CANADIAN DOLLARS (1,000.00
        CAD), in addition to refunding the principal amount of the Remittance
        and any fees and costs you may have paid to Waverlite to send it, unless
        you have contacted Waverlite before you send your Remittance and have
        obtained our written agreement to a higher limit on liability. If we
        agree to a higher limit on liability, we may charge you for it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        Under no circumstances will Waverlite be liable for any incidental,
        indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages or the like. THE
        PLATFORM AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS

        13. Error Resolution and Cancellation Policy
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        For error resolution, transaction cancellation, questions, complaints or
        a written explanation of your rights, contact us at
        support@waverlite.email. Because Waverlite pays Remittances to
        Beneficiaries immediately, your Remittance is typically not cancellable
        or refundable. If you believe that you sent a Remittance in error, you
        must contact us within thirty (30) minutes after you initiated it at
        support@waverlite.email, and we will attempt to recall it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        If your Remittance has not yet been credited to your Beneficiary's
        account, we will refund it to you (including all fees, if any) within
        three (5) business days. However, if the Remittance has already been
        credited to your Beneficiary's account we will be unable to cancel it.
        If you notify us that the account number, telephone number, Beneficiary
        name or other information that you provided to us when you initiated
        your Remittance was incorrect, we will promptly use reasonable efforts
        to recover the amount of your Remittance, but we may be unable to do so
        if your Remittance has already been paid or credited in accordance with
        the information you provided.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        You have a right to dispute errors in your transaction. There is no
        charge for this service. If you think there is an error, contact us at
        support@waverlite.email within 180 days after you sent your Remittance,
        and provide your name, contact information, the Beneficiary's name, the
        date of your transfer, as well as the reason you believe there has been
        an error.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        We will investigate and determine whether an error occurred, and we will
        complete the investigation within 10 weeks (56 days). We will inform you
        of the results of the investigation within three (5) business days after
        the investigation is completed. You may request copies of any documents
        we used in our investigation.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        If Waverlite was at fault, we will refund the total amount you paid,
        including fees, if any, within one business day, or as soon as
        reasonably practicable.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        Waverlite will pay all refunds (whether resulting from a canceled or
        disputed Remittance) either by a credit to your Payment Account or by
        check payment, at Waverlite's option. Alternatively, you can choose to
        have Waverlite process the Remittance again for no additional charge.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        However, if Waverlite has not charged your Payment Account, but an
        authorization hold for the amount to be charged by Waverlite has been
        placed on the funds at your bank, Waverlite will cancel the transaction
        and request that the authorization hold at your bank is released. This
        process can take several days; that timing depends on the relationship
        between your bank and our payment processor, over which we have no
        control. Except for our obligation to investigate and refund described
        above, Waverlite is not liable to you for any loss resulting from
        Waverlite's inability to cancel or refund a Remittance.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">14. Indemnity</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        In consideration of our agreement to provide you with the Platform and
        Service, you agree to indemnify and hold Waverlite harmless from and
        against any and all claims, suits, judgments, executions, liabilities,
        losses, damages, costs, and expenses - including reasonable attorney's
        fees - in connection with or arising out of (i) your use of the Platform
        or the Service, (ii) your breach of this Agreement, or (iii) Waverlite
        acting upon your request for a Remittance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing indemnification
        obligation, you shall indemnify Waverlite for any losses caused due to
        any inaccurate, non- current or incomplete information that you provided
        to Waverlite and for any losses due to your failure to maintain the
        secrecy and confidentiality of all your IDs, passwords, or due to any
        unauthorized use of your ID and/or password.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-[26px] font-bold mb-6">
        15. Arbitration of Disputes
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        For Remittances originated in Canada, all disputes will be resolved by
        arbitration at Canadian Arbitration Association pursuant to the general
        Canadian Arbitration Association Rules for Arbitration. Any Party may
        serve notice of its desire to refer a dispute to arbitration. The
        arbitration shall be held in the most populous city in the province
        where the Remittance was sent. The arbitration shall proceed in
        accordance with the provisions of the applicable provincial Arbitration
        Act. Where allowed neither party shall have the right to participate in
        any class of claimants pertaining to any claim and Third parties' claims
        shall not be joined in any arbitration between Waverlite and you. The
        decision arrived at by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding and
        no appeal shall lie therefrom. Judgement upon the award rendered by the
        arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Each party
        will pay for its own attorneys, experts and witnesses. The costs of the
        arbitrator(s) shall be divided equally between the parties.
      </p>

        Agreement, any amendment to this Agreement, and all notices relating to

        notice to you, Waverlite will notify you by SMS-text message or email,
        at the telephone number or email address that you provided when
        registering for the Platform, or Waverlite will provide you with a link
        in such SMS-text message or email to where you may view the revised or
        amended Agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-text text-[20px] mb-5">
        We will make available to you a record of each of your Remittances
        electronically on the Platform. In order to use the Platform, you must

        You agree that if you remove your consent to receive electronic
        communications, Waverlite will terminate your use of the Platform and
        Service.

        part, without notice to you and without your consent. If any portion of
        this Agreement is determined to be invalid, the remaining provisions
        will nevertheless be enforceable.
